# horiseon-refactor



## Horiseon Refactored with the use of HTML and CSS concepts


 ## HTML

- I removed numerous div's that had nothing to do with the code as they are just replacing semantic elements and replaced it with semantic elements that corresponds to it
- I solved the problem wherein the Search Engine Optimization in nav bar wasn't working by correcting the id in line number 29.
- I gave the images their alt attributes.




 ## CSS
 
 
 
 - I removed all dots that makes semantic element become class in the style.css. 
 - I also integrated all repetitive codes into 1 code in style.css. 
 - I added a root code for some repetitive values to add some style in it. 

 ## Usage


 <img src="./ezgif-3-9af1c03331.gif" alt="A screenrecording of the site" height="720px">
